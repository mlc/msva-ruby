- xul-ext:
  - improve listener logic
  - initialization check that agent is running
  - improve logging (do we need levels?)
  - give "monkeysphere" info in:
    - favicon
    - cert validity in certificate view dialog for site
  - add tool? menu item clear all monkeysphere cache
  - cache 'apd.uid' should be 'apd.host'
  - should manual cache clear reload page? (doesn't for cert clear)
  - status menu option to get site cert
  - status menu option to delete site cert?

- msva (perl):
  - not logging very much
    - log "query received" (at least)
  - not accepting MONKEYSPHERE_ env vars
