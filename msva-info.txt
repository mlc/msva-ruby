msva is the Monkeysphere Validation Agent.

Its goal is to simplify bindings between cryptographic tokens and the
real-world entities that humans actually care about.

In its current technical conception, is a minimal HTTP server that
accepts two requests:

POST /reviewcert (vars: uid, context, pkc)
POST /extracerts (vars: certificates)

the variables that are posted are posted in a JSON string (*not* as www-form-encoded).

the variables that are returned are application/json as well.

(PKC means: public key carrier: raw key, OpenPGP cert, or X.509 cert)
(UID means: User ID (like in OpenPGP))
(context means: (this is too vague right now) something like "this certificate was used to try to identify an HTTPS server")
